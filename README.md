In order to do so, we must share data between our two ~~clans~~ organizations. Linkfire has choosen to store and handle data feeds and files by storing them in ~~large heavy cauldrons~~ AWS S3 buckets. As you find your self in this story, you must be on the journey of data replication. 

You think about our collaboration and must decide, Do you want to?
