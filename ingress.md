### How to deliver data to Linkfire

#### üë©‚ÄçüíºClient Setup

*‚ÑπÔ∏è This document should be sent to the client. It contians all of the steps required for the client to enable replication from their S3 bucket to our Linkfire S3 bucket.*



## üìã Required Information

### Source Account (Client)

### Destination Account (Linkfire)



## Step 1

### Enable Versioning

Ensure versioning is enabled on the client owned source bucket.

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
--bucket <CLIENT BUCKET NAME> \
--versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
```

Linkfire will do the same on its buckets.

---

In the AWS Management Console you can enable Versioning by going to the Properties Tab of your bucket and Clicking Enable.

## Step 2

### Create Role & Permissions

Save the following file locally as: `S3-role-trust-policy.json`. This is your trust policy template.

```json
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Principal":{
            "Service":"s3.amazonaws.com"
         },
         "Action":"sts:AssumeRole"
      }
   ]
}
```

Create Role and apply trust policy template.

```bash
aws iam create-role \
--role-name Linkfire_Replication_Role \
--assume-role-policy-document file://s3-role-trust-policy.json
```

*‚ö†Ô∏è Grab that ARN from the newly created role. you will need it later.*



Next, the following step will create the `Linkfire_Replication_Role` policy which you will attach to the new role you just created.

Save the following file as: `S3-role-permissions-policy.json`
This is the policy you will bind to the role:

```json
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "s3:GetObjectVersionForReplication",
            "s3:GetObjectVersionAcl"
         ],
         "Resource":[
            "arn:aws:s3:::<CLIENT BUCKET NAME>/*"
         ]
      },
      {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "s3:ListBucket",
            "s3:GetReplicationConfiguration"
         ],
         "Resource":[
            "arn:aws:s3:::<CLIENT BUCKET NAME>"
         ]
      },
      {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "s3:ReplicateObject",
            "s3:ReplicateDelete",
            "s3:ReplicateTags",
            "s3:GetObjectVersionTagging"

         ],
         "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::<LINKFIRE BUCKET NAME>/*"
      }
   ]
}
```

Now bind the policy to the new role:

```bash
aws iam put-role-policy \
--role-name Linkfire_Replication_Role \
--policy-document file://s3-role-permissions-policy.json \
--policy-name Linkfire_Replication_Role_Policy
```



## Step 3

### Add Replication to the bucket

Save the following file as: `replication.json` This will enable replication on the bucket as long as the roles and policies are in place:

*‚ö†Ô∏è Update the `Role` with the ARN of the role you created before this.*

```
{
  "Role": "aws:iam::<CLIENT AWS ACCOUNT ID>:role/Linkfire_Replication_Role",
  "Rules": [
    {
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Priority": "1",
      "DeleteMarkerReplication": { "Status": "Disabled" },
      "Filter" : {},
      "Destination": {
        "Bucket": "arn:aws:s3:::<LINKFIRE BUCKET NAME>",
        "Account":"<LINKFIRE AWS ACCOUNT ID>",
        "AccessControlTranslation":{"Owner":"Destination"}
      },
    }
  ]
}
```

Run the following command to add the replication configuration to your source bucket. Be sure to provide source-bucket name.

```
aws s3api put-bucket-replication \
--replication-configuration file://replication.json \
--bucket <CLIENT BUCKET NAME>
```

---

Through the AWS Management Console, If you click on the Management Tab while in your S3 bucket, you can create a new Replication Rule.

Select Entire Bucket and click Next

![Screen Shot 2020-10-22 at 1.07.23 PM](/Users/adyrcz/Desktop/Screen Shot 2020-10-22 at 1.07.23 PM.png)

On the following screen you will assign the destination settings.

Choose the `LINKFIRE AWS ACCOUNT ID` and the `LINKFIRE BUCKET NAME` for the BUCKET IN ANOTHER ACCOUNT option.

Click Save, and then under the Object Ownership option, click `Change object ownership to destination bucket owner` checkbox.

 Click Next, Provide a Choose your Role Name, give the rule a name, copy the policy and click Next, 

Be sure to review your settings and then click Save.



## Step 4

### Verify

Run the following command against your bucket to verify you have enabled replication.

```
aws s3api get-bucket-replication \
--bucket <CLIENT BUCKET NAME>
```

### Test

```
aws s3 cp testfile.txt s3://CLIENTBUCKETNAME
```



## Step 5

### Profit

Notify your Linkfire account manager or the security engineer that you are working with that you have enabled versioning and the s3 bucket policy, and we will the test and ensure replication/delivery is fully enabled.
